What was all the hype for?,Fever,13 August 1998,I honestly don't know what all the hype was for This was a terrible movie  There was absolutely no plot even Twister had a deeper story line It is truly sad when we rely solely on special effects to entertain us. Yes it had some funny parts and some of the aliens were pretty cool but 49 cents is all I'd pay to see this one  And of course they're making a sequel  I can't even imagine what that'll be like.
Will vs. the Aliens,Wild-2,10 August 1998,An enjoyable movie which teams two great actors (Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith) together in a movie of laughs action and special effects However the movie wasn't on the top 250 Until 'Titanic' I would have expected this movie to be hailed by the people as the best of 97 I guess I just expected too much
Overhyped,Horormfn˜,9 December 1998,Yeah this movie was ok but it wasn't one of the best movies i've seen Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones are both good in the titles roles but the movie itself has a plot line as thin as a piece of notebook paper and some of the jokes aren't funny Plus the dialogue is dumb So i went to see this movie expecting to see a great movie and I didn't I give Men In Black a 5 out of 10 It was OK but not what it was hyped to be
Better than I expected,SaraK,1 December 1998,I'm not a big sci-fi fan so I didn't expect this to be a very good movie Overall it was pretty funny Without Tommy Lee Jones it probably wouldn't have been as good
I'd recommend it!,Dee-26,29 November 1998,The cast was great The special effects were fantastic Will & Tommy make a great team
Aliens are among us and the men in black keep it secret,JerBear-2˜,18 November 1998,As usual Will Smith is decidedly likable Tommy Lee Jones is decidedly craggy and Linda Fiorintino is decidedly hot The movie would have improved however with less effects and a little more plot Even with a plot that is a little weak the movie's fun because it exploits and satirizes so many UFO stories and urban myths Will Smith pretty much plays the same character he always plays but it still works He pretty much savedwell almostwell not really that awful Independence Day Talk about needing a plot- one that made sense But then that's for another set of comments MIB may not be the block buster it was hyped as but it is an enjoyable movie worth watching a couple of times
Much hope for the future,Zara,14 November 1998,After Men in Black - there can only be made better films Movies aren't about special effects or about publicity
Like other mid-late 90s movies this one is hard to please.,Jason C. Atwood,6 November 1998,Of all the big movies released in the uncertain 1990s FORREST GUMP JURASSIC PARK TOY STORY and CLUELESS (no joke!) set all-time high water marks in innovation and creativity that equals up to timelessness Not so with MEN IN BLACK! The costume designs and attitudes of Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones was what made it original making this a franchise worth a hot sell but that's the whole problem! This was Sony's finest hour back in the summer of 1997 after striving through miserable flops at the box office only to have stumbled again with the high-tech remake of GODZILLA combined with more than $50 million of promotional advertising Nobody wins in a game of risk when a product lacks the expectations we take for granted! It's a crying shame that Will 'Fresh Prince' Smith's oddball acting performance kept INDEPENDENCE DAY from being a true bona fide science fiction classic so you know what to expect from him in this movie I'll wish him good luck on his successful music recording career The visuals look duplicated as with other recent efforts on a budget of $70 million and the action is mighty scarce Why in the hell does Hollywood have to blow excess dough on special effects? Just so that the audience can say 'WOW!' or 'IT LOOKS GOOD!' and keep coming back to the movie theater? The answer is a simple NO!! Even if MEN IN BLACK has the wow factor and looks good it has no redeeming quality! Despite the luxury it has the typically stupid jokes and puns contained here means it's branded as a 'comedy' a very mainstream but tiring Hollywood genre with virtually no taste Expect the usual things come the sequel The future outlook is going to be terribly bleak for the big studios due to the fact that big budget movies will have all show and no go combined with huge marketing campaigns worth millions Sony isn't the only one in the red though Warner needs to focus more on how not to make a flop instead of endless campaigning over BATMAN movies!
A cool movie,blanka-2,9 October 1998,This is one of the coolest movies I've seen! I love this film This is also one of the most clever films I have seen this is great
Sneaks up on ya!,su niles˜,26 September 1998,This is one of those movies that for me didn't hit me as the trailers indicated It was only after seeing it again (and then again) that I caught subtle lines which were amazingly funny A lot of cultural literacy humor that if you were not socially aware you would miss i e when after his military candidates failed to use their imagination Zed said 'You're everything we've come to expect from years of government training' Nice sleeper of a movie
A must in every video collection,garfield-10˜,15 September 1998,Definetely one of the best movies of the decade A colossal mixture of special effects and humour I fell out of my seat laughing
